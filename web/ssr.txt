me -> browse http:localhost:3000
-> next.js server
-> request graphql server http:localhost:4000
-> next.js server building the html
-> sending back to your browser

next-js only do server side rendering(ssr) when the first page load, that's
why when we do routing to another page and comeback to the first/initial page
it will show the loading indicator
